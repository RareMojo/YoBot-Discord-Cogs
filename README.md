# YoBot-Discord Cogs

Welcome to the official Cogs repository for the YoBot-Discord bot.

Cogs are essentially Python scripts that function as extension modules for your YoBot, allowing for additional functionality and customization.

<br>

> :warning: **IMPORTANT: These are Python scripts which can execute arbitrary code on your system. It's crucial that you review each Cog before downloading and installing it into your YoBot. Never download a Cog from a source that you don't trust.**

<br>

## Cogs Installation - First Time Setup

During the initial setup of your YoBot, the setup wizard will ask if you want to download extra Cogs from this repository. Here are the options:

1. **Download all Cogs:** Select this option to download and install all the available Cogs in this repository automatically.

2. **Download selected Cogs:** Choose this option if you want to install specific Cogs. You'll need to specify which Cogs you want to download. Check the list of Cogs in this repository for their names and functions.

3. **Skip downloading Cogs:** Choose this option to skip the downloading of any Cogs during the initial setup.

## Cogs Management - Terminal Commands

After your YoBot is set up and running, you can manage your Cogs using terminal commands. The primary command for this purpose is `getcogs`.

The `getcogs` command triggers the Cog download wizard, just like in the initial setup. Here's what you can do with this command:

1. **Download Cogs:** Trigger the Cog download wizard by running the `getcogs` command. You can choose to download all Cogs or select specific ones.

2. **Reload Cogs:** After the download, `getcogs` will automatically reload all the Cogs in your YoBot, ensuring any new functionality is immediately ready.

3. **Resync Discord Commands:** The `getcogs` command also offers the option to resync the commands on your Discord server with those in your YoBot.
